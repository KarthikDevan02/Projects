Image Encryption for Facial Recognition Systems


Overview
This project explores the use of image encryption techniques to enhance the security of facial recognition systems. By encrypting images, we aim to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and tampering.


Data Preparation:

Loaded a grayscale image of Lena.
Reshaped the grayscale image to a suitable format for processing.
Autoencoder Training:

Utilized a convolutional autoencoder model to compress and reconstruct the grayscale image.
Trained the autoencoder model for a specified number of epochs using mean squared error (MSE) loss and the Adam optimizer.
Image Encryption:

Implemented a logistic encryption algorithm using logistic maps and a provided key.
Encrypted the Lena image using the logistic encryption algorithm with different keys.
Image Decryption:

Implemented a corresponding decryption algorithm using logistic maps and the same key used for encryption.
Decrypted the encrypted Lena images to obtain the original images.
Visualization:

Displayed the original grayscale image, encrypted images, and decrypted images using matplotlib.

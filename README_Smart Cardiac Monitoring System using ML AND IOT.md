Smart Cardiac Monitoring System using ML AND IOT

## Objective
The objective of the Smart Cardiac Monitoring System was to develop a wearable device equipped with sensors for continuous monitoring of various health parameters related to cardiac health, such as heart rate, temperature, and motion. The collected data was transmitted to a cloud server for analysis. Machine learning algorithms were then employed to predict and detect abnormalities or signs of heart diseases, enabling early clinical alerts and intervention.

## Implementation
### Data Collection:
- Wearable devices with sensors were used to collect real-time data on heart rate, temperature, and motion.
- The collected data was transmitted to a cloud server for storage and analysis.

### Machine Learning Model Training:
- The collected data was preprocessed to remove noise and inconsistencies.
- Machine learning models were trained using the preprocessed data.
- Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM, and RandomForest were explored for prediction.

### Prediction and Analysis:
- The trained machine learning models were utilized to predict and analyze cardiac health parameters.
- The performance of the models was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall.

### System Architecture:
- A hardware setup consisting of NodeMCU, Arduino Nano, sensors, and a smartphone application was designed.
- Software components were developed for data transmission, communication protocols, and machine learning algorithms.
- A cloud server infrastructure (e.g., Blynk server) was implemented for data storage and analysis.

## Results and Analysis
### Algorithm Analysis:
- The performance of machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM, RandomForest) in predicting cardiac health parameters was evaluated.
- Accuracy, precision, and recall of the models were measured using test data.
- The performance of different algorithms was compared, and the most effective one for cardiac health prediction was identified.

### System Performance:
- The overall performance of the Smart Cardiac Monitoring System in terms of data collection, transmission, analysis, and prediction was assessed.
- The system's ability to detect abnormalities or signs of heart diseases accurately and efficiently was validated.

### Future Works and Enhancements:
- Exploration of the integration of additional sensors for more comprehensive health monitoring.
- Enhancement of the machine learning models by incorporating more advanced algorithms and techniques.
- Extension of the functionality of the system to support real-time monitoring and personalized health recommendations.

## Conclusion
The Smart Cardiac Monitoring System demonstrated the potential of IoT and machine learning technologies in improving healthcare by enabling continuous monitoring and early detection of cardiac health issues. By leveraging wearable devices and cloud-based analysis, the system offered a scalable and efficient solution for proactive healthcare management. Further research and development efforts could enhance the system's capabilities and contribute to better patient outcomes in cardiac care.

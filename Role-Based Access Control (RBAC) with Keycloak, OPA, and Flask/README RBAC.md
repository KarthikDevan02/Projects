## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Keycloak, OPA, and Flask


This project demonstrates Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation using Keycloak, Open Policy Agent (OPA), and Flask. It allows access to protected resources based on user roles and permissions defined in Keycloak, with additional access control enforcement through OPA.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

1.keycloak_config.py: Configuration file for Keycloak integration.
2. opa_integration.py: Integration with Open Policy Agent for access control enforcement.
3. logging_config.py: Configuration file for logging access attempts and errors.
4. app.py: Main Flask application for providing access to protected resources.

## Usage
Ensure the Keycloak, OPA, and Flask installed and configured in your environment.
Replace the placeholder values in keycloak_config.py with your actual Keycloak configuration (client ID, realm name, and client secret key).
Adjust the OPA server URL in opa_integration.py according to your OPA setup.
Run the Flask application using python app.py.
Access the protected resources using appropriate access tokens.


## Implementation 
1.Keycloak is used for user authentication and management of roles and permissions.
2.OPA is employed to enforce fine-grained access control policies based on user context and attributes.
3. Logging is configured to record access attempts, errors, and warnings for auditing and monitoring purposes.

## Keycloak Integration
Keycloak serves as the identity and access management system, offering features such as user authentication, role-based authorization, and user management. By integrating Keycloak into the application, we leverage its capabilities to authenticate users and manage their roles and permissions.

## Open Policy Agent (OPA)
OPA acts as the policy engine, enabling fine-grained access control and policy enforcement based on user attributes, roles, and permissions. By defining policies in OPA, we can enforce access control rules dynamically and centrally manage access policies across different services and resources.

## Flask Application
The Flask application serves as the backend service responsible for providing access to protected resources. It interacts with Keycloak for user authentication, OPA for access control enforcement, and logs access attempts and errors for auditing and monitoring purposes.

## Conclusion
The RBAC implementation with Keycloak, OPA, and Flask provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing access control in modern applications. By leveraging the capabilities of Keycloak for user management, OPA for policy enforcement, and Flask for application logic, organizations can ensure secure access to resources while maintaining flexibility and scalability in their systems.
